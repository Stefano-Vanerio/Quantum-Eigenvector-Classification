# Quantum Eigenvector Classification/Eigenface Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains the code used to perform the experiments related to the Quantum Eigenvector Classification/Eigenface Recognition algorithm studied in my thesis work. The notebook `Face Recognition Yale.ipynb` contains the code used for the task of Eigenfaces Recognition using the [Extended Yale B Dataset](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~leekc/ExtYaleDatabase/ExtYaleB.html). The notebook `Darknet_experiments.ipynb` contains the code used for the task of Network Anomaly Detection using Eigenvector Classification using the dataset obtained using the code in this [repository](https://github.com/tommasofioravanti/sq-learn-experiments).
